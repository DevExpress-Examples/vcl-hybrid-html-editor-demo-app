# A Proof-of-Concept for Hybrid VCL Components (Powered by JS/DevExtreme Wrappers for Delphi)

The demo application in this repository illustrates the idea of hybrid VCL applications that rely on a [WebView component](https://docwiki.embarcadero.com/Libraries/Athens/en/Vcl.Edge.TEdgeBrowser) (an embedded web browser) in a native container app for Microsoft Windows.

The **HTML Editor** demo project relies on the [TEdgeBrowser](https://docwiki.embarcadero.com/Libraries/Athens/en/Vcl.Edge.TEdgeBrowser) component from the standard VCL library to display the [JavaScript DevExtreme HTML Editor](https://js.devexpress.com/React/Documentation/18_2/ApiReference/UI_Widgets/dxHtmlEditor/) wrapped into [WebPack](https://webpack.js.org/) to eschew the internet connection requirement.

The editor switches between light and dark [CSS DevExtreme themes](https://js.devexpress.com/jQuery/Documentation/Guide/Themes_and_Styles/Predefined_Themes/) in response to switching between corresponding [DevExpress VCL skins and palettes](https://docs.devexpress.com/VCL/150003/ExpressSkinsLibrary/vcl-skin-library).

## How to Configure JS Widgets in Delphi Code

The DevExtreme HTML editor interacts with the [VCL Ribbon](https://docs.devexpress.com/VCL/dxRibbon.TdxRibbon) through Delphi code. The following code example illustrates the image insertion command available in the Ribbon UI:

```
procedure TfmHtmlEditor.acEditImageExecute(Sender: TObject);
var
  ADialog: TdxImageDialogForm;
  AImageInfo: TdxHtmlEditorImageInfo;
begin
  AImageInfo := nil;
  if HtmlEditor.SelectedTextFormat.IsImage then
    AImageInfo := HtmlEditor.GetImageInfo();

  if AImageInfo = nil then
    AImageInfo := TdxHtmlEditorImageInfo.Create;
  try
    ADialog := TdxImageDialogForm.Create(nil);
    try
      ADialog.Url := AImageInfo.Src;
      ADialog.Width := AImageInfo.Width;
      ADialog.Height := AImageInfo.Height;
      if ADialog.ShowModal = mrOk then
        HtmlEditor.InsertImageByUrl(ADialog.Url, ADialog.Width, ADialog.Height);
    finally
      ADialog.Free;
    end;
  finally
    AImageInfo.Free;
  end;
end;
```

## Prerequisites
